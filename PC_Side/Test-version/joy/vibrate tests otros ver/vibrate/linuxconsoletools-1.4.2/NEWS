Version 1.4.2
-------------

* The udev rule matching w8001 devices has been split to handle
  devices using different baud rates, and the different baud rates are
  documented.

* inputattach no longer resets the line discipline before exiting when
  it discovers the device is already managed by another inputattach
  instance.

* jscal-store creates its target directory if necessary.


Version 1.4.1
-------------

* inputattach correctly handles non-retry errors other than EINTR
  (thanks to Alexander Clouter <alex@digriz.org.uk> for the patch).


Version 1.4
-----------

* inputattach no longer aborts when it receives a recoverable signal
  (thanks to Kees Cook <kees@ubuntu.com> for the patch).


Version 1.4rc1
--------------

The following user-visible changes have been made since the last
commonly used snapshot (20051019):

* inputattach has been cleaned up, and now supports the following new
  devices:
  - Sahara Touch-iT213
  - PS/2 multiplexers on TQM85xx boards
  - Zhen Hua PCM-4CH RC transmitters
  - TAOS evaluation modules
  - Wacom W8001
  - Microtouch, Touchright, Touchwindow, Penmount and Fujitsu
    touchscreens

* jscal tolerates greater jitter (so joysticks which don't send stable
  values can still be calibrated).

* jscal supports axis and button remapping.

* Various USB devices which caused jscal and/or jstest to segfault are
  now handled correctly.

* jscal-store and jscal-restore allow joystick calibration and
  remapping settings to be stored and restored.

* Documentation is provided, with manpages for all the provided
  utilities and sample udev rules.

In addition, the 20051019 snapshot included the following user-visible
changes since version 1.2.15:

* jstest includes axis and button names.

* New utilities:
  - inputattach connects devices to the input layer, allowing them to
    be used even if they are not directly supported;
  - force-feedback utilities;
  - evtest event-layer monitoring utility.
